Debugging a Program:-

The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. The player gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). 
However, the program has several bugs in it. Run through the program a few times to find the bugs that keep the program from working correctly.


import random
guess = ''
while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
 print('Guess the coin toss! Enter heads or tails:')
 guess = input()
toss = random.randint(0, 1) # 0 is tails, 1 is heads
if toss == guess:
 print('You got it!')
else:
 print('Nope! Guess again!')
 guesss = input()
 if toss == guess:
 print('You got it!')
 else:
 print('Nope. You are really bad at this game.')

import random
def coinToss():
    number = input("Number of times to flip coin: ")
    recordList = []
    heads = 0
    tails = 0
    for amount in range(number):
         flip = random.randint(0, 1)
         if (flip == 0):
              print("Heads")
              recordList.append("Heads")
         else:
              print("Tails")
              recordList.append("Tails")
    print(str(recordList))
    print(str(recordList.count("Heads")) + str(recordList.count("Tails")))
